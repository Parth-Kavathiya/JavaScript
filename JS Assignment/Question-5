(5). What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?

-> undefined

undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable. When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is initialized with the value undefined. For example:

    let x;
    console.log(x); // undefined

-> Undeclared

undeclared refers to a variable that has not been declared at all. In other words, it is a variable that does not exist in the current scope. For example:

    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
