(2). How many type of Variable in JavaScript? 

Variable in Programming is a named storage location that holds a value or data. These values can change during the execution of a program, hence the term “variable.” Variables are essential for storing and manipulating data in computer programs. A variable is the basic building block of a program that can be used in expressions as a substitute in place of the value it stores.

-> Declaration of Variable in Programming:
In programming, the declaration of variables involves specifying the type and name of a variable before it is used in the program. The syntax can vary slightly between programming languages, but the fundamental concept remains consistent.

e.g. :
    // Syntax: var/let/const variable_name;
    var age;
    let price;
    const grade = 'A';  // Note: Constants need to be initialized during declaration.

Types :

(1). Primitive Variables:
    - Number: A numeric value, such as 42 or 3.14.
    - String: A sequence of characters, such as "hello" or 'hello'.
    - Boolean: A true or false value, such as true or false.
    - Null: A special value that represents the absence of any object value, denoted by null.
    - Undefined: A special value that represents an uninitialized variable, denoted by undefined.

(2). Reference Variables:
    - Object: A collection of key-value pairs, such as { name: 'Parth', age: 19 }.
    - Array: A collection of values, such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
    - Function: A block of code that can be executed, such as function add(x, y) { return x + y; }.

(3). Variable Declarations
    - let: A block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
    - const: A block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned.
    - var: A function-scoped variable that can be reassigned (legacy, avoid using).
